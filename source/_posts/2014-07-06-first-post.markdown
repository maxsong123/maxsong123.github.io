This here is my first octopress post! I wonder how easy it is to use, and 
how to do different types of formatting. I guess as I add more to this 
post, it will generate more interesting things below. 

To generate markup - how do i insert a link? 
[this is a link]({% post_url 2014-07-06-first-post %})
